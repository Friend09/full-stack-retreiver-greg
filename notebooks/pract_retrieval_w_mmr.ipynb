While environmental costs should be taken\\ninto account, they don\\'t\\nmake wealth a zero-sum game.  For example, if you repair\\na machine that\\'s broken because a part has come unscrewed,\\nyou create wealth with no environmental cost.[5b]\\nThis essay was written before Firefox.[6]\\nMany people feel confused and depressed in\\ntheir early twenties.  Life seemed so much more fun in college.\\nWell, of course it was.  Don\\'t be fooled by the surface similarities.\\nYou\\'ve gone from guest to servant.\\nIt\\'s possible to have fun in this new world. \\nAmong other things, you now get to go behind the doors that say\\n\"authorized personnel only.\"\\nBut the change is a shock at first, and all the worse\\nif you\\'re not consciously aware of it.[7]\\nWhen VCs asked us how long it would take another startup\\nto duplicate our software, we used to reply that they probably\\nwouldn\\'t be able to at all. I think this made us seem naive,\\nor liars.[8]\\nFew technologies have one clear inventor.  So as\\na rule, if you know the \"inventor\" of something\\n(the telephone, the assembly line, the airplane, \\nthe light bulb, the transistor) it is because their\\ncompany made money from it, and the company\\'s PR people worked\\nhard to spread the story.  If you don\\'t know who invented\\nsomething (the automobile, the television, the computer,\\nthe jet engine, the laser), it\\'s because other companies\\nmade all the money.[9]\\nThis is a good plan for life in general.\\nIf you have two choices, choose the harder.\\nIf you\\'re trying to decide whether to go out running or\\nsit home and watch TV, go running.\\nProbably the reason this trick works so well is that\\nwhen you have two choices and one is harder, the\\nonly reason you\\'re even considering the other is laziness.', metadata={'language': 'No language found.', 'source': 'http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html', 'title': 'How to Make Wealth'})"
